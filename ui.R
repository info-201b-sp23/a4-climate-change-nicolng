                is actively seeking to improve. It only shows their annual, per capita, cumulative, and consumption-based emissions. What if a country is actively improving
                their environment but it won't show on the charts. What if it is only one large corporation that is emitting all the carbon? Do other companies who are going 
                green but in the same country also take the blame? Having a very broad data does lead to some downsides and these are only just a few of the flaws in this
                data that we can properly assess. Implementing the amount of companies or the net worth of company can prove better information, or even ESG score can make this
